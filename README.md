# Corrector for Vector
**A plugin for QGIS**  
Designed to correct, move and repair polygons that have been improperly digitized (or digitized on a bad map) and that exhibit offsets and distortions.  
You simply draw as many deformation arrows (simple linestrings) as needed.  
And choose to process it either with or without PostGIS (faster with PostGIS).
